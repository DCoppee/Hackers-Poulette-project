# Hackers Poulette

## What's in it

Solo project as part of my WebDev training @BeCode (01-31-2023)

## The mission

    The company Hackers Pouletteâ„¢ sells Raspberry Pi accessory kits to build your own. They want to allow their users to contact their support team. My mission was to create a fully-functioning online "contact support" form, in PHP. It must display a contact form and process the received answer (sanitize, validate, answer the user).

##  Features

* Use of PHP (not exclusively) 
* Database with PDO connection
* Semantically valid and accessible form's html code
* Useful visual clue about the error in case of wrong input, below the input field
* Readable and helpful error message (and funny)
* Sanitised and validated data (server side)
* Data send to the database once the form is validated
* Spam prevention using honeypot
* Responsive format
* Nice visual
