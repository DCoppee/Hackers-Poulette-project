# Hackers Poulette Project

This solo project was realized during my Web Dev training @BeCode. It is part of the PHP learning.

## What is Hackers Poulette ?

The company Hackers Pouletteâ„¢ sells Raspberry Pi accessory kits to build your own. They want to allow their users to contact their support team. 

## Mission

My mission was to create a fully-functioning online "contact support" form, in PHP. It had to display a contact form and process the received answer (sanitize, validate, answer the user).

##  Languages and features

* Use of PHP (not exclusively) 
* Database with PDO connection
* Semantically valid and accessible form's HTML code
* Useful visual clue about the error in case of wrong input, below the input field
* Readable and helpful (and funny) error message
* Sanitised and validated data (server side)
* Data send to the database once the form is validated
* Spam prevention using honeypot
* Use of SASS
* Responsive format
* Nice visual
